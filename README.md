### Hi there 👋
  
⚡ I’m currently working on Arduino library for flip-disc displays.  
<FlipDisc.h> library is intended for use with the displays designed by www.Flipo.io - Marcin Saj.
The library allows you to easily control displays connected in series. You can connect up to 8 different displays in any order.
